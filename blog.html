                <p class="card-text"><b>local Storage:</b> is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save
                    key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser
                    will persist even after the browser window is closed.</p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    <b>Session storage:</b> is a popular choice when it comes to storing data on a browser. It enables
                    developers to save and retrieve different values. Unlike local storage, session storage only keeps
                    data for a particular session. The data is cleared once the user closes the browser window.

                <h4 class="card-title">What is difference between global scope and block scope?</h4>
                <p class="card-text"><b>The global scope:</b> is the context where everything in a Javascript program
                    executes by default. This scope includes all variables, objects, and references that are not
                    contained within a customized scope defined by a programmer. Global scope is the entire Javascript
                    execution environment.</p>

                <p class="card-title"> <b>The block scope:</b> restricts a variable's access to the block in which it is
                    declared. The var keyword assigns a function scope to the variable. Unlike the var keyword, the let
                    keyword allows the script to restrict access to the variable to the nearest enclosing block.</p>

                    but not given a value.

                <h4 class="card-title">What is javascript event loop?</h4>
                <p class="card-text"> <mark>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible
                        for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued
                        sub-tasks.</mark><br>
                    <b>An event loop</b> is often times the “main” of a program that handles events. If
                    written a program that user knows it will exit when it is done. Programs that run
                    indefinitely like UI applications, video games, web servers, etc will have some form of an event
                    loop.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>For instance</b> when a program running a UI. If it's idle and we check the
                    running
                    processes it's likely not going to be eating up a ton of processing time by continually looping. It
                    can either be utterly silent or it may be taking up a fraction of a percent of the CPUs time. But if
                    we go and hit a button the program is going to wake up and do something. This is ran by an event
                    loop. Clicking that button fired an event which got processed by the event loop which called the
                    buttons onClick event handler.

                    They're fairly primitive, but they're highly useful.
